Those interested in learning more about these methods should start by reading Chapter 10 of [*Numerical Methods for Economists*](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/numerical-methods-economics) by Ken Judd before proceeding to John Butcher's excellent book entitled [*Numerical Methods for solving Ordinary Differential Equations*](http://www.shivanian.com/teaching%20avtivities/Butcher.pdf).\n",

From the graphic it should be clear that the size of the error will depend criticaly on the choice of the step size, $h$. The step size parameter, $h$, controls the \"fineness\" of the $t$ grid: a smaller step size requires a larger number of grid points to cover any arbitrary interval $[t_0, t_0 + t^*]$. Does the forward Euler method converge to the exact solution, $k(t)$ on the arbitrary interval $[t_0, t_0 + t^*]$ as the step size, $h \\rightarrow 0$, toward zero? Yes it does! How fast does the forward Euler method converge to the true solution? Not very! The approximation error of the forward Euler method is proportional to the step size, $h$, implying that reducing the step size by a factor of 10 only reduces the approximation error by a factor of 10."

      "Four of the best, most widely used ODE integrators have been implemented in the `scipy.integrate` module (they are called `dopri5`, `dop85`, `lsoda`, and `vode`). Each of these integrators uses some type of adaptive step-size control: the integrator adaptively adjusts the step size $h$ in order to keep the approximation error below some user-specified threshold). The cells below contain code which compares the approximation error of the forward Euler with those of [`lsoda`](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/nsde/pubs/u113855.pdf) and [`vode`](http://jeffreydk.site50.net/papers/BDFmethodpaper.pdf). Instead of simple linear interpolation (i.e., `k=`1), I set `k=5` for 5th order [B-spline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline) interpolation."
